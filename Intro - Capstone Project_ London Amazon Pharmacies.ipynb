Their online pharmacies allow customers to purchase their medication on the Amazon online marketplace and get it delivered to their home address extremely conveniently, without ever having to leave their home. This is a highly disruptive move against the brick and mortar pharmacy sector.</p>\n    \n   <br> \n<p>However, unlike industries such as grocery or automotive, many pharmaceutical manufacturers don't have the luxury of serving a mass market. Orders are often smaller, more individualized, and more last-minute in nature than in other business sectors. Moreover, professionals working in the medical device industry can't as readily predict exactly where or when their materials will be needed.</p> <p>As a result, Amazon needs distribution centers that offer optimal reach and flexibility, compared to their larger distribution centers.</p>\n   <br> \n  <p>Therefore, this is a opportunistic time for Amazon to move into central London's commercial real estate market under the assumption that prices should now be a lot lower than before the COVID19 pandemic in order to build smaller distribution centers closer to their customers.
